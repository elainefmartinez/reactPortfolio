                I have worked for Target for six years and am currently a Senior Specialist within Target.com.  
                Over the last two years I have had the opportunity to attend coding bootcamps with both Hackbright Academy  
                and the University of Minnesota.  While I have worn many hats during my time with Target, I can say with confidence 
                I have enjoyed having the opportunity to learn coding the most.
